# Third-party software and assets

The repository contains project-owned code plus a modified vendored copy of
PsyCross. Release packages also dynamically link several libraries installed by
the vcpkg manifest.

The release packager copies the exact dependency notices into its `licenses/`
directory and writes `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` at the package root.

PsyCross is vendored rather than referenced as a submodule because this port
requires local GPU, GTE, PGXP, framebuffer, filtering, input and crash-handling
changes. Its original upstream is <https://github.com/OpenDriver2/PsyCross> and
the vendored base revision is `e56e4cd`.

The `assets/dossiers/screens` images and launcher icon are presentation assets
for this fan project. They do not grant any rights to *Syphon Filter*, its
characters, artwork or trademarks. Do not reuse or redistribute original game
data outside the rights granted by its owner.
